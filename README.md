# The Data Set
The dataset is a real world dataset generated by a water pump operating in a rural area, the dataset was obtained from kaggle using the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data

> Note: The data is not in the github repo due to its large size, If you would like to use the code, make sure to download it.

The dataset is relatively large consisting of 1 timestamp column, 1 machine status columnm 52 sensor columns and 200k+ observations
